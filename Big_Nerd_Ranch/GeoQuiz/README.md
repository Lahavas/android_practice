### Ch01 Your First Android Application

* App Basics
* Creating an Android Project
* Navigating in Android Studio
* Laying Out the UI
    * The view hierarchy
    * Widget attributes
    * Creating string resources
    * Previewing the layout
* From Layout XML to View Objects
    * Resources and resource IDs
* Wiring Up Widgets
    * Getting references to widgets
    * Setting listeners
* Making Toasts
* Running on the Emulator
* For the More Curious: Android Build Process
    * Android build tools

#### 주요 개념

* **activity**
    * An instance of **Activity** class
    * Managing user interaction with a screen of information
  
* **layout**
    * A set of UI objects and their positions on the screen
    * **Widget**
        * An instance of **View** class or one of its subclasses
        * The building blocks you use to compose a UI
        * Every widget has a corresponding **XML element**
            * The name of the element is the type of the widget
            * Each element has a set of **XML attributes**
                * Each attribute is an instruction about how the widget should be configured
  
* View Hierarchy
    * A hierarchy of **View** objects
    * **ViewGroup**
        * A widget that contains and arranges other widgets
  
* **Resource**
    * A piece of your application that is not code
    * image files, audio files, and XML files (layout, strings, etc.)
    * **Resource ID**
        * To access a resource in code
        * integer constant
        * in R.java file
            * Android generated a resource ID for the entire layout and for each string
            * Android did not generated IDs for the individual widgets
  
* How do XML elements become View objects?
    * As part of the build process
        * aapt(Android Asset Packaging Tool) compiles layout file resources into a more compact format
        * When **setContentView(...)** is called in the **onCreate(Bundle)** Method, the Activity uses the **LayoutInflater** class to instantiate each of the View objects as defined in the layout file
    * Wiring up widgets
        * get *references* to the inflated View objects
        * set *listeners* on those objects to respond to user actions
  
* Android Build Process
    * The Android tools take *resources*, *codes*, and *AndroidManifest.xml* file
        * AndroidManifest.xml contains metadata about the application
    * And turn them into an *.apk file*

    * Using Logcat
    * Exploring the activity lifecycle by example
* Rotation and the Activity Lifecycle
    * Device configurations and alternative resources
        * Creating a landscape layout
* Saving Data Across Rotation

        * Inflating widgets and putting them on screen
    * Getting references to inflated widgets
    * Setting listeners on widgets to handle user interaction

* **Device Configuration**
    * A set of characteristics that describe the *current state* of an individual device
        * Screen orientation, Screen density, Screen size, Keyboard type, Dock mode, Language, and more
    * **Runtime Configuration Change**
        * onPause() -> onStop() -> **onDestroy()** -> onCreate(Bundle) -> onStart() -> onResume()
    * Configuration Qualifier
        * Configuration qualifiers on *res* subdirectories are how Android identifies which resources best match the current device configuration
    * **onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)**
        * This method is called before onStop()
        * **Bundle** object
            * a structure that maps string keys to values of certain limited types

        * **Intent.putExtra(...)**
        * **Activity.getIntent(...)**
  
* **startActivity(Intent)**
    * When an activity calls this method, this call is sent to the part of OS called by **ActivityManager**
        * The ActivityManager creates the **Activity** instance
        * This calls its **onCreate(Bundle)** method
