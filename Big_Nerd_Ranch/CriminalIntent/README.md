#### 주요 개념

* **Fragment**
    * A controller object that the activity can deputize to perform tasks
    * UI Fragment
        * *UI Flexibility*
            * The ability to compose and recompose an activity's view at runtime
    * Hosting a UI Fragment
        * add the fragment
            * to the activity's layout
                * *layout fragment*
            * **in the activity's code**
  
* **FragmentManager**
    * Managing your fragments
    * Adding their views to the activity's view hierarchy
    * Handling two things
        * A list of fragments
        * A back stack of **fragment transactions**
    * When an activity is destroyed
        * **FragmentManager** saves out its list of fragments
  
* **Fragment Transaction**
    * To add, remove, attach, detach, or replace fragments in the fragment list
    * **add(...)**
        * A container view ID
        * the newly created Fragment
  
* Fragment Lifecycle
    * Fragment lifecycle methods are called by the hosting activity
        * Fragment lifecycle methods must be *public*
    * Called when you add the fragment to the **FragmentManager**
        * **onAttach(Context)**
        * **onCreate(Bundle)**
            * has a **Bundle**
                * **onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)**
            * Configure the fragment instance
        * **onCreateView(...)**
            * Inflate the layout for the fragment's view
                * LayoutInflater
                    * **LayoutInflater.inflate(...)**
                        * Passing in the layout's resource ID
                * ViewGroup
                    * Need to configure the widgets properly
            * Return the inflated View to the *hosting activity*
            * The place to *wiring up some widgets*
    * Called after the hosting activity's **onCreate(Bundle)** method has executed
        * **onActivityCreated(Bundle)**
  
* Maven
    * Dependency Management Tool
    * groupId:artifactId:version
