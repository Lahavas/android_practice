    * Hosting a UI Fragment
        * add the fragment
            * to the activity's layout
                * *layout fragment*
            * **in the activity's code**
  
* **FragmentManager**

    * Adding their views to the activity's view hierarchy
    * Handling two things
        * A list of fragments
        * A back stack of **fragment transactions**
    * When an activity is destroyed
        * **FragmentManager** saves out its list of fragments

#### 주요 개념

* Singleton
    * A class that allows only one instance of itself to be created
    * A singleton exists as long as the application stays in memory
  
* **List<E>**
    * An interface that supports an ordered list of objects of a given type
  
* **RecyclerView**
    * A subview of ViewGroup
    * Displaying a list of child View objects
    * **ViewHolder**
        * It holds on to a **View**
        * *itemView*
            * It holds a reference to the entire View you passed into **super(view)**
    * **Adapter**
        * A controller object that sits between the **RecyclerView** and *the data set* that the RecyclerView should display
            * Creating the necessary **ViewHolder**s
            * binding **ViewHolder**s to data from the model layer
  
* RecyclerView-Adapter conversation
    * **getItemCount()**
        * The RecyclerView asks how many objects are in the list
    * **onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup, int)**
        * To create a new ViewHolder
    * **onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder, int)**
        * The adapter will look up the model data for that position
        * and *bind* it to the ViewHolder's View
    * Once enough ViewHolders have been created, RecyclerView stops calling **onCreateViewHolder(...)**

    * View Size Setting
        * Fixed
            * Xdp
        * Wrap Content
            * wrap_content
        * Any Size
            * 0dp
    * **Constraint Handle**
  
* **Layout Attribute**
    * *density-independent dimension unit*
        * px (pixel)
        * **dp** (density-independent pixel)
            * One dp is always 1/160th of an inch on a device's screen
            * When your display is a higher density, dp will expand to fill a larger number of screen pixels
        * **sp** (scale-independent pixel)
            * sp is dp that also take into account the user's font size preference
            * You will **almost always use sp** to set display text size
        * pt, mn, in
            * pt (point) : 1/72 of an inch
            * mn (millimeters)
            * in (inches)
    * **Margin**
        * *Layout Parameter*
            * They determine *the distance between widgets*
    * **Padding**
        * Telling the widget *how much bigger than its contents* it should draw itself
    * **Style**
        * An XML resource that contains attributes that describe how a widget should look and behave
        * in *res/values/*
        * *@style/my_own_style*
    * **Theme**
        * A collection of styles
        * *theme attribute reference*
            * You tell Android's runtime resource manager
                * "Go to the app's theme and find the attribute named '...'"

### Ch10 Using Fragment Arguments

* Starting an Activity from a Fragment
    * Putting an extra
    * Retrieving an extra
    * Updating CrimeFragment's view with Crime data
    * The downside to direct retrieval
* Fragment Arguments
    * Attaching arguments to a fragment
    * Retrieving arguments
* Reloading the List
* Getting Results with Fragments
* For the More Curious: Why Use Fragment Arguments?

#### 주요 개념

* Two ways a fragment can access data in its activity's intent
    * Direct retrieval
        * use **getActivity()**
        * Fragment is no longer a reusable building block
            * It will *always be hosted* by an activity
    * **Fragment Arguments**
        * Every fragment instance can have a **Bundle** object attached to it
            * *Argument Bundle*
                * key-value pairs
                * Each pair is known as an *argument*
  
* **newInstance()**
    * To Create the fragment instance
    * To Bundle up and set its arguments
  
* Getting results with fragments
    * Only activities have results
        * While Fragment has its own **startActivityForResult(...)** and **onActivityResult(...)** methods
        * It does not have any **setResult(...)** methods
    * In Fragment, *getActivity().setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK, null);*

### Ch11 Using ViewPager

* Creating CrimePagerActivity
    * ViewPager and PagerAdapter
    * Integrating CrimePagerActivity
* FragmentStatePagerAdapter vs FragmentPagerAdapter
* For the More Curious: How ViewPager Really Works
* For the More Curious: Laying Out Views in Code

#### 주요 개념

* **ViewPager**
    * To your UI lets users navigate between list items by swiping across the screen to "page" forward or backward
    * **PagerAdapter**
        * **FragmentStatePagerAdapter**
            * Unneeded fragment is destroyed
                * A transaction is committed to remove the fragment from your activity's FragmentManager
                    * **remove(Fragment)**
            * **getCount()**
            * **getItem(int)**
        * **FragmentPagerAdapter**
            * When your fragment is no longer needed, FragmentPagerAdapter calls **detach(Fragment)** on the transaction
  
* To implement the raw **PagerAdapter** interface
    * To host normal **View** objects in a ViewPager
    * **PagerAdapter.instantiateItem(ViewGroup, int)**
        * To create an item view for a given position
        * To add it to a container ViewGroup
    * **PagerAdapter.destroyItem(ViewGroup, int, Object)**
        * To destroy that item
    * **PagerAdapter.isViewFromObject(View, Object)**
        * To figure out which item's view it is
        * The Object parameter is an object received from a call to **instantiateItem(...)**

        * Using a **FragmentManager**
            * A transaction will automatically be created and committed
            * **show(FragmentManager, String)**
        * Using a **FragmentTransaction**
            * For creating and committing that transaction
            * **show(FragmentTransaction, String)**
  
* Passing Data Between Two Fragments that are hosted by the same activity
    * use *newInstance()* and *target fragment*
        * **setTargetFragment(Fragment, int)**
            * This method accepts the fragment that will be the target and a request code just like one you send in **startActivityForResult(...)**
        * **Fragment.onActivityResult(...)**
            * After the activity has received the call, the activity's **FragmentManager** then calls this method on the appropriate fragment
            * When dealing with two fragments hosted by the same activity, you can borrow this method
    * Other solution... see later chapter
